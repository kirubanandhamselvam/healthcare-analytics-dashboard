# 🏥 Healthcare Operations Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an executive-level Healthcare Operations Analytics Dashboard designed for a multi-city hospital chain in India.  

The dashboard enables centralized monitoring of patient admissions, operational efficiency, treatment costs, and departmental performance using Power BI and data modeling techniques.

# 🏢 1. Industry Overview

The healthcare industry in India has experienced rapid growth, particularly in multi-specialty hospital chains operating across multiple cities.

With increasing patient inflow across departments such as:
- Cardiology
- Orthopedics
- Neurology
- Emergency Care
- General Medicine

Operational complexity has significantly increased.

Without structured analytics and centralized monitoring, hospitals may face:
- Inefficient service delivery
- Increased operational costs
- Poor resource allocation
- Delayed strategic decisions

To remain financially sustainable and competitive, hospital management must adopt data-driven decision-making systems.

# 👤 2. Stakeholder Profile

**Primary Stakeholder:** Chief Operations Officer (COO)

The COO oversees hospital operations across five cities and is responsible for:

- Monitoring patient admissions
- Allocating medical staff efficiently
- Evaluating department performance
- Tracking revenue and operational costs
- Ensuring operational efficiency

Currently, operational data is fragmented across departments and cities, limiting strategic visibility.

A centralized analytics dashboard is required.

# 🚨 3. Business Problem Statement

The hospital chain lacks a unified analytics system to monitor:

- Patient admissions
- Department efficiency
- Treatment costs
- Resource utilization

As a result:

- Monthly admission trends are unclear
- Department-wise cost comparison is difficult
- Length of stay is not consistently tracked
- High-cost treatments are not easily identified
- Decision-making remains reactive

The organization requires a consolidated, data-driven analytics solution.

# 🎯 4. Business Objectives

The objective of this project is to design an executive-level operational dashboard that enables data-driven decisions.

### Specific Goals:

1. Monitor patient inflow trends across cities
2. Track department efficiency using length of stay
3. Identify high-cost treatments
4. Analyze revenue contribution by department
5. Improve hospital resource utilization
6. Support strategic planning with performance insights

---

# ❓ 5. Key Business Questions

The dashboard is designed to answer:

- Which department has the highest admissions?
- What is the average length of stay per department?
- Which treatments generate the highest revenue?
- Are admissions increasing month-over-month?
- Which city has the highest operational cost?
- Which departments require performance improvement?

These questions guide the analytical model and dashboard design.

---

# 📊 6. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard tracks the following KPIs:

- Total Admissions
- Total Revenue
- Average Length of Stay
- Cost per Patient
- Department Utilization Rate
- Monthly Growth %
- Top 5 Cost-Intensive Treatments

These KPIs provide an executive-level performance overview.
